EP:{"Class_Name":"EP -","General_Group":"Aquatic Vegetation","Class_Name2":"Aquatic vegetation ","Class_Definition":"Aquatic vegetation with floating or exposed leaves, and frequently heavy stems which emerge about the surface. Shallow water is always found where these grow. An estimate can easily be made as to the distance from shore these forms are found and the same mapped. Common forms are: Water lilies, The water arums, Pickerel weeds, Lake rushes, Pipes or equesetium, Cat-tails, Wild rice , Wapato = Sagittaria, These are all an index to duck and musk rat food.","General_Group_Definition":"All points of shore line contact should be carefully mapped or water vegetation since these forms not only have much to do with the formation of peat and marl and the final closing in of the bog shore line and the disappearance of open water but with food and shelter of wild life. Of course the inventory of aquatic vegetation as taken from base lines is a mere index of what may be expected in more detailed study."}
